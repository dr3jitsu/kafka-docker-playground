# Fully Managed Oracle CDC Source (Oracle 19c) Source connector

## Objective

Quickly test [Fully Managed Oracle CDC Source Connector](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-oracle-cdc-source/index.html) with Oracle 19c.

N.B: if you're a Confluent employee, please check this [link](https://confluent.slack.com/archives/C0116NM415F/p1636391410032900) and also [here](https://confluent.slack.com/archives/C0116NM415F/p1636389483030900).

Download Oracle Database 19c (19.3) for Linux x86-64 `LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip`from this [page](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/oracle19c-linux-downloads.html) and place it in `./LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip`


Note: The first time you'll run the script, it will build (using this [project](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/blob/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/README.md)) the docker image `oracle/database:19.3.0-ee`. It takes about 10 minutes.

## Exposing docker container over internet

**ðŸš¨WARNINGðŸš¨** It is considered a security risk to run this example on your personal machine since you'll be exposing a TCP port over internet using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com). It is strongly encouraged to run it on a AWS EC2 instance where you'll use [Confluent Static Egress IP Addresses](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/networking/static-egress-ip-addresses.html#use-static-egress-ip-addresses-with-ccloud) (only available for public endpoints on AWS) to allow traffic from your Confluent Cloud cluster to your EC2 instance using EC2 Security Group.

An [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) auth token is necessary in order to expose the Docker Container port to internet, so that fully managed connector can reach it.

You can sign up at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
If you have already signed up, make sure your auth token is setup by exporting environment variable `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN`

Your auth token is available on your dashboard: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

Ngrok web interface available at http://localhost:4551

## Prerequisites

All you have to do is to be already logged in with [confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/overview.html#confluent-cli-overview).

By default, a new Confluent Cloud environment with a Cluster will be created.

You can configure the cluster by setting environment variables:

* `CLUSTER_CLOUD`: The Cloud provider` (possible values: `aws`, `gcp` and `azure`, default `aws`)
* `CLUSTER_REGION`: The Cloud region (use `confluent kafka region list` to get the list, default `eu-west-2`)
* `ENVIRONMENT` (optional): The environment id where want your new cluster (example: `env-xxxxx`) 

In case you want to use your own existing cluster, you need to setup these environment variables:

* `ENVIRONMENT`: The environment id where your cluster is located (example: `env-xxxxx`) 
* `CLUSTER_NAME`: The cluster name
* `CLUSTER_CLOUD`: The Cloud provider (possible values: `aws`, `gcp` and `azure`)
* `CLUSTER_REGION`: The Cloud region (example `us-east-2)
* `CLUSTER_CREDS`: The API_KEY:API_KEY_SECRET to use, it should be separated with semi-colon (example: `<API_KEY>:<API_KEY_SECRET>`)
* `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_CREDS` (optional, if not set new ones will be used): The Schema Registry API_KEY:API_KEY_SECRET to use, it should be separated with semi-colon (example: `<SR_API_KEY>:<SR_API_KEY_SECRET>`)


## How to run

```
$ ./fully-managed-ibm-mq-source.sh <NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN>
```

## Note on `redo.log.row.fetch.size`

The connector is configured with `"redo.log.row.fetch.size":1` for demo purpose only. If you're planning to inject more data, it is recommended to increase the value.

Example with included script [`07_generate_customers.sh`](https://github.com/vdesabou/kafka-docker-playground/blob/master/connect/connect-cdc-oracle19-source/sample-sql-scripts/07_generate_customers.sh.zip) (packaged as `.zip`in order to not be run automatically), which inserts around 7000 customer rows, in that case you would need to set `"redo.log.row.fetch.size":1000`:

```
cd sample-sql-scripts
unzip 07_generate_customers.sh.zip 
cd -
# insert new customer every 500ms
./sample-sql-scripts/07_generate_customers.sh "ORCLCDB" 0.5
# insert new customer every second (default)
./sample-sql-scripts/07_generate_customers.sh "ORCLCDB" 
```
